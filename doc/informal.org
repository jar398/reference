Principia semantica...
Principles of compositional semantics...

Communication is mysterious.  When we try to explain it we speak of
"facts" or "meanings" that are "conveyed" "about" "objects".  There is
an array of words like this whose meanings are elusive, in a manner
similar to the "phlogiston" and "humour" of medieval
pre-scientists.  We do not know how to point to these things or
measure them in the physical world.  Our understanding of them is
pre-scientific.

This is not to say we are wrong to speak of "meanings" and so on, or
that these are inherently useless words; just that these abstract words
are mysterious and demand explanations.

For a proper understanding of communication we have to first embrace
that it occurs in physical systems, so that theory is grounded in
reality.  Observing a physical system, we should be able to point to
the parts involved in the use of any of our mystery words, or improve
on those words with more principled vocabulary.

A physical system manifesting communication would include parts that
communicate (send 'messages'), parts that are recipients of messages, channels
such as air or water over which messages are sent, parts that are
of mutual concern to sender and recipient, and linkages between the
senders or recipients and the parts of mutual concern.

One approach to the study of communication is to study the apparatus
that accomplishes it, such as the brain of a human.  While this is
certainly interesting, my concern is with communication as behavior,
not as mechanism.  This is similar to the distinction between studying
the physics of an engine's internals (compression ratios, fuel
composition, and so on) and what the engine does as seen from the
outside (force exerted, acceleration, noise, and so on).  By focusing
on behavior we get away from human-centrism and treat any sort of
communicating entity uniformly.  That might be a human, monkey,
chameleon, circulatory system of a plant, a robot, etc.

I need a noncommittal term to refer to something involved in
communication.  The word /agent/ comes from computer science and is
appropriate because it suggests action on the world.

Just as two engines with completely different internal mechanisms may
have the same external competence with regard to generating power, two
agents with wildly different internal mechanisms may have the same
external competence with regard to communicating.

Another approach to the study of communication is /semantics/, which
in linguistics is mainly concerned with equivalences ("same meaning")
between sentences and between words or phrases.  Semantics of natural
languages is an empirical study but is "disembodied" in the sense that
its examples make no reference to any particular physical system.

Yet another approach to communication is /information theory/, which
famously has little to do with information.  Its focus is on encoding
and compression of messages, and ideas like "channel capacity" and
"bandwidth", not on what messages mean.
