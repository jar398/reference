[v3: new through "in a manner"]

Communication is mysterious.  When we try to explain it we speak of
"facts" or "meanings" that are "conveyed" "about" "objects".  There is
an array of words like this whose meanings are elusive, in a manner
similar to the "phlogiston" and "humour" of medieval
pre-scientists.  We do not know how to point to these things or
measure them in the physical world.  Our understanding of them is
pre-scientific.

This is not to say we are wrong to speak of "meanings" and so on, or
that these are inherently useless words; just that these abstract words
are mysterious and demand explanations.

For a proper understanding of communication we have to first embrace
that it occurs in physical systems, so that theory is grounded in
reality.  Observing a physical system, we should be able to point to
the parts involved in the use of any of our mystery words, or improve
on those words with more principled vocabulary.

[v3: new text starting "of mutual concern"]

A physical system manifesting communication would include parts that
communicate (send 'messages'), parts that are recipients of messages, channels
such as air or water over which messages are sent, parts that are
of mutual concern to sender and recipient, and linkages between the
senders or recipients and the parts of mutual concern.

2. The study of communication

[v3: mostly new or reorganized text from here on down]

I thought it might be helpful to orient the current project among
various ways that communication is addressed in the scientific literature.
It is OK to skip this section.

/Psychophysiology:/
One approach to the study of communication is to look at the apparatus
that accomplishes it, such as the brain of a human.  While this is
certainly interesting, my concern is with communication per se, not
any particular kind of mechanism that shows it.  This is similar to
the distinction between studying the physics of an engine's internals
(compression ratios, fuel composition, and so on) and what the engine
does as seen from the outside (force exerted, acceleration, and
so on).  By focusing on behavior we get away from human-centrism and
can treat any sort of communicating entity uniformly.  That might be a
human, monkey, chameleon, circulatory system of a plant, a robot, etc.

Just as two engines with completely different internal mechanisms may
have the same external competence with regard to generating power, two
communicators with wildly different internal mechanisms may have the same
external competence with regard to communicating.

/Psychology:/
Some areas of psychology are concerned with behavior as observed and
not with apparatus.  Some psychological studies must consider the case
where the behavior in question is communication.  I am not an expert
in psychology and need to learn enough to be able to make a statement
about it here.  But I am pretty sure that psychological approaches
begin with quite different assumptions from what I'm looking for.  In
particular the goal of psychology is to understand the (human) mind, a
question I exclude.

/Linguistics, semantics, pragmatics:/
Linguistics offers many lines of attack.  Mostly it is concerned with
language, which of course has communication as its purpose.  Phonetics
and grammar tell us about language but not its meaning (in the sense
of grounding in the world).  /semantics/ in linguistics is mainly
concerned with equivalences ("same meaning") between sentences and
between words or phrases, but not meaning itself.  Semantics of
natural languages is an empirical study but is "disembodied" in the
sense that its examples make no reference to any particular physical
system.

There is also a subfield "pragmatics" relating language to the world
which I don't know much about.  I expect the focus of pragmatics is
the behavior of individuals and not a systems view of pairs or groups,
but I don't know.

/Information theory:/
Yet another approach to communication is information theory, which
famously has little to do with information.  Its focus is on encoding
and compression of messages, and transmission-related ideas like
"channel capacity" and "bandwidth", not on what messages mean.

/Technical languages:/
"Semantics" as used in computer science comes close to providing
grounded theories of communication, in settings where we control the
internal apparatus (program) that creates communication.  In computer
science meaning is described either through equivalences between
artificial languages or through description of effects of messages.
The effects might be input and/or output, but they are described not
as effects on the world, but as effects on the computer's input or
output devices.  Thus computational semantics is almost always
"internal" (or as I sometimes like to say, /solipsistic/) as opposed
to physical.

3. Definitions

/agent/ - something that communicates or is meaningfully communicated
with (human, other mammal, robot, etc.)

/channel/ - a physical medium, such as vibrating air or paper with
writing, over which agents communicate

/message/ - the physical state of a channel (perhaps spread over some
time) indicating communication of one meaning and not another

/sender/ - the agent that sends a message

/receiver/ - the agent that receives a message

/generation/ - an agent's creation or choice of a message in response to a
current physical state (sensations and/or memory)

/interpretation/ - an agent's creation or choice of an action in response to a
message received over a channel

/meaning/ - TBD


4. Success

A communication event (generate, send, receive, interpret) can be
called "successful" if the outcome - the interpretation - benefits
both sender and receiver.  The sender and receiver have cooperated
to bring about some end.

I will leave "benefit" as an abstraction but I have in mind
"fitness" in the sense of evolution, "economical" in the sense of
economics, or "desired" (by the designer) in the sense of a designed system.

There are many ways in which communication can fail.  There may be no
benefit to sender or receiver because the 'wrong' message is generated
or the message is not understood.  The sender might benefit but not
the receiver; this includes the case of "lying".  This is a sort of
parasitism.  The receiver might benefit but not the sender; this would
be a kind of betrayal or misplaced trust.

Composition (messages built out of parts) is what makes humans unique 

Why composed messages are harder than simple messages

The most difficult problem is to understand simple subject/predicate sentences.
